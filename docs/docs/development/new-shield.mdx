## Overview

This guide will walk through the steps necessary to add ZMK support for a keyboard that uses an add-on MCU board (e.g. Pro Micro compatible) to provide the microprocessor.

The high level steps are:

- From a template, create a new [Zephyr module](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/develop/modules.html) housed in a git repository containing one or more custom shields.
- Create a new shield directory.
- Add the base Kconfig files.
- Add the shield overlay file to define the KSCAN driver for detecting key press/release.
- (Optional) Add the matrix transform for mapping KSCAN row/column values to sane key positions. This is needed for non-rectangular keyboards, or where the underlying row/column pin arrangement does not map one to one with logical locations on the keyboard.
- Add a default keymap, which users can override in their own configs as needed.
- Add a `<my_shield>.zmk.yml` metadata file to document the high level details of your shield, and the features it supports.
- Update the `build.yaml` file from the repository template to have some sample builds of the firmware to test.
- Add support for features such as encoders, OLED displays, or RGB underglow.

It may be helpful to review the upstream [shields documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/hardware/porting/shields.html#shields) to get a proper understanding of the underlying system before continuing.

:::note
ZMK support for split keyboards requires a few more files than single boards to ensure proper connectivity between the central and peripheral units. Check the following guides thoroughly to ensure that all the files are in place.
:::

## New Zephyr Module Repository

The first step to creating the shield is to create a new Zephyr module repository from a template.

:::note
This guide assumes you already have a configured GitHub account. If you don't yet have one, go ahead and [sign up](https://github.com/join) before continuing.
:::

Follow these steps to create your new repository:

- Visit https://github.com/zmkfirmware/unified-zmk-config-template
- Click the green "Use this template" button
- In the drop down that opens, click "Use this template".
- In the following screen, provide the following information:
  - A repository name, e.g. `my-shield-module`.
  - A brief description, e.g. `ZMK Support For MyShield Keyboard`.
  - Select Public or Private, depending on your preference.
- Click the green "Create repository" button

## New Shield Directory

:::note
This guide describes how to add a shield to an independently managed Zephyr module repository. This is the
preferred way to handle boards and shields moving forward in ZMK, although the tooling to make this easier
for users is still improving. ZMK does have a collection of boards/shields in the ZMK main repository, which are planned to be phased out, but until that is complete, there _may_ be a few select scenarios where adding your keyboard to ZMK itself is preferred. Due the volume of PRs and the focus of ZMK development not being merging of keyboard PRs, you are highly encouraged to use an out-of-tree Zephyr module repository to manage your definitions. Should you choose to try to get your keyboard included in ZMK main repository, the paths in the rest of the guide would be nested under the `app/` folder there instead. For example, `boards/shields/<keyboard_name>` should now be
`app/boards/shields/<keyboard_name>`.
:::

Shields in Zephyr module "board root" go into the `boards/shields/` directory; that means the new shield directory in your module repository should be:

```bash
mkdir boards/shields/<keyboard_name>
```

## Base Kconfig Files

:::tip[Example shields]
You can check out the [`shields` folder](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/tree/main/app/boards/shields) in the ZMK repo that houses [the in-tree supported shields](../hardware.mdx) in order to copy and modify as a starting point.
:::

There are two required Kconfig files that need to be created for your new keyboard
shield to get it picked up for ZMK, `Kconfig.shield` and `Kconfig.defconfig`.

### Kconfig.shield

The `Kconfig.shield` file defines any additional Kconfig settings that may be relevant when using this keyboard. For most keyboards, there is just one additional configuration value for the shield itself.

```kconfig
config SHIELD_MY_BOARD
    def_bool $(shields_list_contains,my_board)
```

:::warning
Kconfig uses only commas for delimiters, and keeps all whitespaces in the function call. Therefore do not add a whitespace after the comma when configuring your shield as this would be treated as <code>&nbsp;my_board</code> (with a leading whitespace) and will cause issues.
:::

This will make sure that a new configuration value named `SHIELD_MY_BOARD` is set to true whenever `my_board` is used as the shield name, either as the `SHIELD` variable [in a local build](build-flash.mdx) or in your `build.yaml` file [when using Github Actions](../customization). Note that this configuration value will be used in `Kconfig.defconfig` to set other properties about your shield, so make sure that they match.

**For split boards**, you will need to add configurations for the left and right sides. For example, if your split halves are named `my_board_left` and `my_board_right`, it would look like this:

```kconfig
config SHIELD_MY_BOARD_LEFT
    def_bool $(shields_list_contains,my_board_left)

config SHIELD_MY_BOARD_RIGHT
    def_bool $(shields_list_contains,my_board_right)
```

### Kconfig.defconfig

The `Kconfig.defconfig` file is where overrides for various configuration settings
that make sense to have different defaults when this shield is used. One main item
that usually has a new default value set here is the `ZMK_KEYBOARD_NAME` value,
which controls the display name of the device over USB and BLE.

The updated new default values should always be wrapped inside a conditional on the shield config name defined in the `Kconfig.shield` file. Here's the simplest example file.

:::danger
The keyboard name must be less than or equal to 16 characters in length, otherwise the bluetooth advertising might fail and you will not be able to find your keyboard from your device.
:::

```kconfig
if SHIELD_MY_BOARD

config ZMK_KEYBOARD_NAME
    default "My Board"

endif
```

For split keyboards, `Kconfig.defconfig` needs to specify a few more options.
Which side is central (usually the left) is determined via the configuration in this file.
For that side, the keyboard name is assigned and the central config is set.
The peripheral side is typically not assigned a name since only the central will be advertising for connections to other devices.
Finally, the split config needs to be set for both sides:

```kconfig
if SHIELD_MY_BOARD_LEFT

config ZMK_KEYBOARD_NAME
    default "My Board"

config ZMK_SPLIT_ROLE_CENTRAL
    default y

endif

if SHIELD_MY_BOARD_LEFT || SHIELD_MY_BOARD_RIGHT

config ZMK_SPLIT
    default y

endif
```

## Shield Overlays

<InterconnectTabs items={Metadata} />

To use GPIO pins that are not part of the interconnects as described above, you can use the GPIO labels that are specific to each controller type.
For instance, pins numbered `PX.Y` in nRF52840-based boards can be referred to via `&gpioX Y` labels.
An example is `&gpio1 7` for the `P1.07` pin that the nice!nano exposes in the middle of the board.

<Tabs
defaultValue="unibody"
values={[
{label: 'Unibody Shields', value: 'unibody'},
{label: 'Split Shields', value: 'split'},
]}>

<TabItem value="unibody">

The `<shield_name>.overlay` is the devicetree description of the keyboard shield that is merged with the primary board devicetree description before the build. For ZMK, this file at a minimum should include the chosen node named `zmk,kscan` that references a KSCAN driver instance. For a simple 3x3 macropad matrix,
this might look something like:

```dts
/ {
    chosen {
        zmk,kscan = &kscan0;
    };

    kscan0: kscan_0 {
        compatible = "zmk,kscan-gpio-matrix";
        diode-direction = "col2row";
        wakeup-source;

        col-gpios
            = <&pro_micro 15 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>
            , <&pro_micro 14 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>
            , <&pro_micro 16 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>
            ;

        row-gpios
            = <&pro_micro 19 (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH | GPIO_PULL_DOWN)>
            , <&pro_micro 20 (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH | GPIO_PULL_DOWN)>
            , <&pro_micro 21 (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH | GPIO_PULL_DOWN)>
            ;
    };
};
```

See the [Keyboard Scan configuration documentation](../config/kscan.md) for details on configuring the KSCAN driver.

### .dtsi files and Shield Overlays (Split Shields)

Unlike unibody keyboards, split keyboards have a core .dtsi file with shield overlays for each half of the keyboard.
It is preferred to define only the `col-gpios` or `row-gpios` in the common shield .dtsi, depending on the `diode-direction` value.
For `col2row` directed boards like the iris, the shared .dtsi file may look like this:

```dts
#include <dt-bindings/zmk/matrix_transform.h>

/ {
    chosen {
        zmk,kscan = &kscan0;
        zmk,matrix-transform = &default_transform;
    };

    default_transform: keymap_transform_0 {
        compatible = "zmk,matrix-transform";
        columns = <16>;
        rows = <4>;
// | SW6  | SW5  | SW4  | SW3  | SW2  | SW1  |                 | SW1  | SW2  | SW3  | SW4  | SW5  | SW6  |
// | SW12 | SW11 | SW10 | SW9  | SW8  | SW7  |                 | SW7  | SW8  | SW9  | SW10 | SW11 | SW12 |
// | SW18 | SW17 | SW16 | SW15 | SW14 | SW13 |                 | SW13 | SW14 | SW15 | SW16 | SW17 | SW18 |
// | SW24 | SW23 | SW22 | SW21 | SW20 | SW19 | SW25 |   | SW25 | SW19 | SW20 | SW21 | SW22 | SW23 | SW24 |
//                      | SW29 | SW28 | SW27 | SW26 |   | SW26 | SW27 | SW28 | SW29 |
        map = <
RC(0,0) RC(0,1) RC(0,2) RC(0,3) RC(0,4) RC(0,5)                 RC(0,6) RC(0,7) RC(0,8) RC(0,9) RC(0,10) RC(0,11)
RC(1,0) RC(1,1) RC(1,2) RC(1,3) RC(1,4) RC(1,5)                 RC(1,6) RC(1,7) RC(1,8) RC(1,9) RC(1,10) RC(1,11)

                                RC(4,3) RC(4,4) RC(4,5) RC(4,6) RC(4,7) RC(4,8)
        >;
    };

    kscan0: kscan {
        compatible = "zmk,kscan-gpio-matrix";
        diode-direction = "col2row";
        wakeup-source;

        row-gpios
            = <&pro_micro 6 (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH | GPIO_PULL_DOWN)> // Row A from the schematic file
            , <&pro_micro 7 (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH | GPIO_PULL_DOWN)> // Row B from the schematic file
            , <&pro_micro 8 (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH | GPIO_PULL_DOWN)> // Row C from the schematic file
            , <&pro_micro 0 (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH | GPIO_PULL_DOWN)> // Row D from the schematic file
            , <&pro_micro 4 (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH | GPIO_PULL_DOWN)> // Row E from the schematic file
            ;

    };
};
```

:::note
Notice that in addition to the common `row-gpios` that are declared in the kscan, the [matrix transform](#optional-matrix-transform) is defined in the .dtsi.
:::

The missing `col-gpios` would be defined in your `<boardname>_left.overlay` and `<boardname>_right.overlay` files.
Keep in mind that the mirrored position of the GPIOs means that the `col-gpios` will appear reversed when the .overlay files are compared to one another.
Furthermore, the column offset for the [matrix transform](#optional-matrix-transform) should be added to the right half of the keyboard's overlay
because the keyboard's switch matrix is read from left to right, top to bottom.
This is exemplified with the iris .overlay files.

```dts title=iris_left.overlay
#include "iris.dtsi" // Notice that the main dtsi files are included in the overlay.

&kscan0 {
    col-gpios
        = <&pro_micro 19 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH> // col1 in the schematic
        , <&pro_micro 18 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH> // col2 in the schematic
        , <&pro_micro 15 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH> // col3 in the schematic
        , <&pro_micro 14 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH> // col4 in the schematic
        , <&pro_micro 16 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH> // col5 in the schematic
        , <&pro_micro 10 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH> // col6 in the schematic
        ;
};
```

```dts title=iris_right.overlay
#include "iris.dtsi"

&default_transform { // The matrix transform for this board is 6 columns over because the left half is 6 columns wide according to the matrix.
    col-offset = <6>;
};

&kscan0 {
    col-gpios
        = <&pro_micro 10 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH> // col6 in the schematic
        , <&pro_micro 16 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH> // col5 in the schematic
        , <&pro_micro 14 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH> // col4 in the schematic
        , <&pro_micro 15 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH> // col3 in the schematic
        , <&pro_micro 18 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>  // col2 in the schematic
        , <&pro_micro 19 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>  // col1 in the schematic
        ;
};

```

See the [Keyboard Scan configuration documentation](../config/kscan.md) for details on configuring the KSCAN driver.

### .conf files (Split Shields)

While unibody boards only have one .conf file that applies configuration characteristics to the entire keyboard,
split keyboards are unique in that they contain multiple .conf files with different scopes.
For example, a split board called `my_awesome_split_board` would have the following files:

- `my_awesome_split_board.conf` - Configuration elements affect both halves
- `my_awesome_split_board_left.conf` - Configuration elements only affect left half
- `my_awesome_split_board_right.conf` - Configuration elements only affect right half

In most case you'll only need to use the .conf file that affects both halves of a split board. It's used for adding features like deep-sleep or rotary encoders.

```ini title=my_awesome_split_board.conf
CONFIG_ZMK_SLEEP=y
```

:::note
The shared configuration in `my_awesome_split_board.conf` is only applied when you are building with a [`zmk-config` folder](build-flash#building-from-zmk-config-folder) and when it is present at `config/my_awesome_split_board.conf`. If you are not using a `zmk-config` folder, you will need to include the shared configuration in both `my_awesome_split_board_left.conf` and `my_awesome_split_board_right.conf` files.

## (Optional) Matrix Transform

Internally ZMK translates all row/column events into "key position" events to maintain a consistent model that works no matter what any possible GPIO matrix may look like for a certain keyboard. This is particularly helpful when:

1. To reduce the used pins, an "efficient" number of rows/columns for the GPIO matrix is used, that does _not_ match the physical layout of rows/columns of the actual key switches.
1. For non rectangular keyboards with thumb clusters, non `1u` locations, etc.

A "key position" is the numeric index (zero-based) of a given key, which identifies
the logical key location as perceived by the end user. All _keymap_ mappings actually bind behaviors to _key positions_, not to row/column values.

_Without_ a matrix transform, that intentionally map each key position to the row/column pair that position corresponds to, the default equation to determine that is:

```c
($row * NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS) + $column
```

Which effectively amounts to numbering the key positions by traversing each row from top to bottom and assigning numerically incrementing key positions.

Whenever that default key position mapping is insufficient, the `<shield_name>.overlay` file should _also_ include a matrix transform.

Here is an example for the [nice60](https://github.com/Nicell/nice60), which uses an efficient 8x8 GPIO matrix, and uses a transform:

```dts
#include <dt-bindings/zmk/matrix_transform.h>

/ {
    chosen {
        zmk,kscan = &kscan0;
        zmk,matrix-transform = &default_transform;
    };

    /* define kscan node with label `kscan0`... */

    default_transform: keymap_transform_0 {
        compatible = "zmk,matrix-transform";
        columns = <8>;
        rows = <8>;
// | MX1  | MX2  | MX3  | MX4  | MX5  | MX6  | MX7  | MX8  | MX9  | MX10 | MX11 | MX12 | MX13 |    MX14     |
// |   MX15   | MX16 | MX17 | MX18 | MX19 | MX20 | MX21 | MX22 | MX23 | MX34 | MX25 | MX26 | MX27 |  MX28   |
// |    MX29    | MX30 | MX31 | MX32 | MX33 | MX34 | MX35 | MX36 | MX37 | MX38 | MX39 | MX40 |     MX41     |
// |     MX42      | MX43 | MX44 | MX45 | MX46 | MX47 | MX48 | MX49 | MX50 | MX51 | MX52 |       MX53       |
// |  MX54  |  MX55  |  MX56  |                  MX57                   |  MX58  |  MX59  |  MX60  |  MX61  |
        map = <
RC(3,0)  RC(2,0) RC(1,0) RC(0,0) RC(1,1) RC(0,1) RC(0,2) RC(1,3) RC(0,3) RC(1,4) RC(0,4) RC(0,5) RC(1,6)     RC(1,7)
RC(4,0)    RC(4,1) RC(3,1) RC(2,1) RC(2,2) RC(1,2) RC(2,3) RC(3,4) RC(2,4) RC(2,5) RC(1,5) RC(2,6) RC(2,7)   RC(3,7)
RC(5,0)     RC(5,1) RC(5,2) RC(4,2) RC(3,2) RC(4,3) RC(3,3) RC(4,4) RC(4,5) RC(3,5) RC(4,6) RC(3,6)          RC(4,7)
RC(6,0)       RC(6,1) RC(6,2) RC(6,3) RC(5,3) RC(6,4) RC(5,4) RC(6,5) RC(5,5) RC(6,6) RC(5,6)                RC(5,7)
RC(7,0)    RC(7,1)   RC(7,2)                     RC(7,3)                    RC(7,5)    RC(7,6)    RC(6,7)    RC(7,7)
        >;
    };

    /* potentially other overlay nodes... */
};
```

Some important things to note:

- The `#include <dt-bindings/zmk/matrix_transform.h>` is critical. The `RC` macro is used to generate the internal storage in the matrix transform, and is actually replaced by a C preprocessor before the final devicetree is compiled into ZMK.
- `RC(row, column)` is placed sequentially to define what row and column values that position corresponds to.
- If you have a keyboard with options for `2u` keys in certain positions, or break away portions, it is a good idea to set the chosen `zmk,matrix-transform` to the default arrangement, and include _other_ possible matrix transform nodes in the devicetree that users can select in their user config by overriding the chosen node.

See the [matrix transform section](../config/kscan.md#matrix-transform) in the Keyboard Scan configuration documentation for details and more examples of matrix transforms.

## Default Keymap

Each keyboard should provide a default keymap to be used when building the firmware, which can be overridden and customized by user configs. For "shield keyboards", this should be placed in the `boards/shields/<shield_name>/<shield_name>.keymap` file. The keymap is configured as an additional devicetree overlay that includes the following:

- A node with `compatible = "zmk,keymap"` where each child node is a layer with a `bindings` array that binds each key position to a given behavior (e.g. key press, momentary layer, etc).

Here is an example simple keymap for the Kyria, with only one layer:

<KeymapExampleFile />

:::note
The two `#include` lines at the top of the keymap are required in order to bring in the default set of behaviors to make them available to bind, and to import a set of defines for the key codes, so keymaps can use parameters like `N2` or `K` instead of the raw keycode numeric values.
:::

### Keymap Behaviors

For documentation on the available behaviors for use in keymaps, see the [overview page for behaviors](../behaviors/index.mdx).

## Metadata

ZMK makes use of an additional metadata YAML file for all boards and shields to provide high level information about the hardware to be incorporated into setup scripts/utilities, website hardware list, etc.

The naming convention for metadata files is `{item_id}.zmk.yml`, where the `item_id` is the board/shield identifier, including version information but excluding any optional split `_left`/`_right` suffix, e.g. `corne.zmk.yml` or `nrfmicro_11.zmk.yml`.

Here is a sample `corne.zmk.yml` file from the repository:

```yaml
file_format: "1"
id: corne
name: Corne
type: shield
url: https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/
requires: [pro_micro]
exposes: [i2c_oled]
features:
  - keys
  - display
siblings:
  - corne_left
  - corne_right
```

You should place a properly named `foo.zmk.yml` file in the directory next to your other shield values, and fill it out completely and accurately. See [Hardware Metadata Files](/docs/development/hardware-metadata-files) for the full details.

## Build File

To help you test/verify your firmware, update the `build.yaml` to list your particular board/shield combinations you want built whenever changes are published to GitHub. Open `build.yaml` with your editor and add a combination, e.g.:

```yaml
# This file generates the GitHub Actions matrix
# For simple board + shield combinations, add them
# to the top level board and shield arrays, for more
# control, add individual board + shield combinations to
# the `include` property, e.g:
#
# board: [ "nice_nano_v2" ]
# shield: [ "corne_left", "corne_right" ]
# include:
#   - board: bdn9_rev2
#   - board: nice_nano_v2
#     shield: reviung41
#
---
include:
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: <my_shield>
```

For split keyboards, you will need to specify the halves/siblings separately, e.g.:

```yaml
include:
  - board: mikoto_520
    shield: <my_shield>_left
  - board: mikoto_520
    shield: <my_shield>_right
```

## Adding Features

### Encoders

EC11 encoder support can be added to your board or shield by adding the appropriate lines to your board/shield's configuration (.conf), device tree (.dtsi), overlay (.overlay), and keymap (.keymap) files.

<Tabs
defaultValue="conf"
values={[
{label: '.conf', value: 'conf'},
{label: '.dtsi', value: 'dtsi'},
{label: '.overlay', value: 'overlay'},
{label: '.keymap', value: 'keymap'},
]}>
<TabItem value="conf">

In your configuration file you will need to add the following lines so that the encoders can be enabled/disabled:

```ini
# Uncomment to enable encoder
# CONFIG_EC11=y
# CONFIG_EC11_TRIGGER_GLOBAL_THREAD=y
```

These should be commented by default for encoders that are optional/can be swapped with switches, but can be uncommented if encoders are part of the default design.

:::note
If building locally for split boards, you may need to add these lines to the specific half's configuration file as well as the combined configuration file.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value = "dtsi">
In your device tree file you will need to add the following lines to define the encoder sensor:

```dts
    left_encoder: encoder_left {
        compatible = "alps,ec11";
        a-gpios = <PIN_A (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH | GPIO_PULL_UP)>;
        b-gpios = <PIN_B (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH | GPIO_PULL_UP)>;
        steps = <80>;
        status = "disabled";
    };
```

Here you need to replace `PIN_A` and `PIN_B` with the appropriate pins that your PCB utilizes for the encoder(s). See [shield overlays section above](#shield-overlays) on the appropriate node label and pin number to use for GPIOs.

The `steps` property should corresponded to the documented pulses per rotation for the encoders used on the keyboard, typically found on the datasheet of the component. If users use different encoders when they build, the value can be overridden in their keymap.

Add additional encoders as necessary by duplicating the above lines, replacing `left` with whatever you would like to call your encoder, and updating the pins. Note that support for peripheral (right) side sensors over BLE is still in progress.

Once you have defined the encoder sensors, you will have to add them to the list of sensors:

```dts
    sensors: sensors {
        compatible = "zmk,keymap-sensors";
        sensors = <&left_encoder &right_encoder>;
        triggers-per-rotation = <20>;
    };
```

In this example, a left_encoder and right_encoder are both added. Additional encoders can be added with spaces separating each, and the order they are added here determines the order in which you define their behavior in your keymap.

In addition, a default value for the number of times the sensors trigger the bound behavior per full rotation is set via the `triggers-per-rotation` property. See [Encoders Config](../config/encoders.md#devicetree) for more details.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value = "overlay">
Add the following lines to your overlay file(s) to enable the encoder:

```dts
&left_encoder {
    status = "okay";
};
```

:::note
For split keyboards, make sure to add left hand encoders to the left .overlay file and right hand encoders to the right .overlay file.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value = "keymap">
Add the following line to your keymap file to add default encoder behavior bindings:

```dts
sensor-bindings = <&inc_dec_kp C_VOL_UP C_VOL_DN>;
```

Add additional bindings as necessary to match the default number of encoders on your board. See the [Encoders](../features/encoders.md) and [Keymap](../features/keymaps.mdx) feature documentation for more details.

## Testing

### GitHub Actions

Using GitHub Actions to build your new firmware can save you from doing any local [development setup](./setup.mdx),
at the expense of a longer feedback loop if there are issues. To push your changes and trigger a build:

- Add all your pending changes with `git add .`
- Commit your changes with `git commit -m "Initial shield"`
- Push the changes to GitHub with `git push`

Once pushed, click on the "Actions" tab of the repo you created in the first step, and you should see a new build running. If the build is successful, there will be a new `firmware.zip` artifact shown on the summary screen you can download that will contain the new `.uf2` files that can be flashed to the device.

### Local Build

:::note
To build locally, be sure you've followed the [development setup](./setup.mdx) guide first.
:::

Once you've fully created the new keyboard shield definition,
you should be able to test with a build command like:

```sh
west build --pristine -b nice_nano_v2 -- -DSHIELD=<my_shield> -DZMK_EXTRA_MODULES=/full/path/to/your/module
# replace <my_shield> with e.g. <my_shield>_left for split keyboards, then repeat for <my_shield>_right
```

The above build command generates a `build/zephyr/zmk.uf2` file that you can flash using the steps from the following section. See the dedicated [building and flashing page](build-flash.mdx) for more details.

### Flashing

If your board
supports USB Flashing Format (UF2), copy that file onto the root of the USB mass
storage device for your board. The controller should flash your built firmware
and automatically restart once flashing is complete. If you need to flash an updated
UF2 file with fixes, you can re-enter the bootloader by double tapping the reset button.

Alternatively, if your board supports flashing and you're not developing from
within a Dockerized environment, enable Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) mode on
your board and run the following command to test your build:

```sh
west flash
```

Please have a look at documentation specific to
[building and flashing](build-flash.mdx) for additional information.

:::note
Further testing your keyboard shield without altering the root keymap file can be done with the use of `-DZMK_CONFIG` in your `west build` command,
shown [here](build-flash.mdx#building-from-zmk-config-folder)
